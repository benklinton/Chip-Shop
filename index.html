            <h2>FAQ</h2>
            <hr>
            <p></p>
            <p><strong>what is a rock chip?</strong></p>
            <p>
                A “rock chip”, is usually created after an object strikes your vehicle’s laminated glass and
                creates a damage spot. In most vehicles only your windshield is laminated, but some side
                windows can be laminated as well. If the object strikes hard enough the glass will separate
                under the surface and create an air pocket in the glass, also known as a crack. If the damage is
                left untreated the glass will continue to separate resulting in the glass having to be removed and
                replaced. The majority of the time a rock is the object flying through the air, thus the name “rock
                chip”.</p>

            <br>

            <p> <strong> How do i know if my windshield needs to be repaired? </strong></p>
            <p>
                Our windshield take a beating daily, especially here in Utah. Lucky for you that is what they are
                designed to do. After the glass is hit a damage spot is created from the glass chipping away.
                Most of the time the damage spot is just a surface chip or a “pit”. The pitting of the windshield is
                nothing to be alarmed of on their own. Though it may be an eyesore the integrity of the glass
                has not been compromised. If the pit has a black or greyish coloring; around, under, or even
                sometimes next to it; that means that the subsurface of the glass has separated and needs to
                be repaired. When separation occurs, an air pocket is created which will cause a shadow to be
                cast in the chip. That is where your black or greyish coloring comes from. It is definitely easier
                to spot the separation in larger chips like star or bullseye breaks, but some cracks can be very
                small measuring only 1⁄4” and hard to see, even these will eventually spread. Once repaired, the
                separated portion of the glass is filled in causing the shadow to disappear making the damage
                less vizable and the glass as solid as glass can get.

            <br>

            <p><strong>Why should I repair my windshield instead of replacing it?</strong></p>
            <p>
                The obvious answer is cost. Windshields are definitely not going down in price, actually it’s
                quite the opposite. With newer car technology more and more components are being added to
                the windshield which drives up the cost of replacement. On some vehicles after it’s replaced it
                must be taken to your dealership to be recalibrated. If you bought a brand new car this year
                and want to replace your windshield, they don’t make aftermarket glass yet for your vehicle so
                you can add on a few hundred more for the factory glass. The national average cost for a
                windshield repair is just over $60.00. Not at Chip Shop though. We start as low as $35.00, but
                most insurance companies will cover the full cost of the repair at no cost to you! Another reason
                would definitely be time and convenance. Most repairs take as little as 10 minutes and we will
                come to you. The next two reasons you might not be aware of but for us they are the MOST
                important. The first is safety. Once you break the factory seal of your windshield your safety
                rating just dropped. A factory sealed windshield is guaranteed stay sealed to your car in a car
                crash. Next time you replace your windshield ask them if they will guarantee that. Plus a lot of

                times you’ll encounter leaking problems or wind noises because of the new moldings put in.
                The next reason is for the longevity of our Planet Earth. Windshields cannot be recycled. Once
                your windshield is removed and replaced, the old windshield gets thrown away and ends up in a
                landfill. Because of the laminate piece in the middle of the glass, the two plates of glass or
                “lites” cannot be separated and reused. We at Chip Shop like to believe that we help save our
                Planet one windshield at a time.
            </p>

            <br>
            <p><strong>Does my insurance cover the cost?</strong></p>
            <p>
                Most insurance companies will cover the full cost of the repair even without glass coverage. It is
                written in your premium under comprehensive coverage, that your deductible will be waived if
                the windshield can be repaired, no matter how large your deductible may be. Insurance
                companies have different regulations on what they deem repairable. For the most part, if you
                can cover the damaged area by a paper dollar bill or “6 inches”, it will be approved for a repair.
                If the repair attempt should fail or if you opt out for a replacement instead of the repair, only then
                would you pay the deductible to have your windshield removed and replaced. A failed repair
                only happens less than 1% of the time. This is due to working on a already broken piece of
                glass that just wants to continue spreading no matter all the precautions we take. Our
                technicians are well trained and certified to take every step in avoiding this unfortunate situation.
                You can always contact us to help you figure out if your insurance will cover it.
            </p>

            <br>
            <p><strong>What if my repaired rock chip spreads?</strong></p>
            <p>
                We warranty all of our work for the life of your windshield or as long as you own your vehicle. If
                the repair should fail we pay you for the full cost of the repair. Rather it be the amount the
                insurance paid or if you paid out of pocket. That way you can put the cost of the repair towards
                the cost of your replacement. Most insurance companies warranties will tell you that it is
                warranted for life, but all that means is that they will assist you in replacing the windshield after
                you pay your deductible. They do not refund any money paid out, but they do deduct the money
                paid to the shop and put it back in their pocket. We also work with many local replacement
                companies so we can help you get a decently priced windshield.
